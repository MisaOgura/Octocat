A branch is a "parallel reality" stemming from the master, where the changes made are sotred separately from the masters. We can swtich between different branches. Changes made in a branch can be merged with the master, as long as there are no conflicts. In case of conflicts, manually edit the file to resolve.

To merge:
	$ git checkout <branch>
	$ git merge master

Rebasing:
Alternatively, to have a cleaner history of commits, we can "rebase" the branch to the master. Checkout each branch and master, reset to the point just before the merge using hash like so:

	$ git reset --hard <hash>

Then rebase as follows:

	$ git checkout <branch>
	$ git rebase master
	$ git hist (make sure the graph is one line)
