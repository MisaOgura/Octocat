In Github, the upstream remote is used to syc the changes you make in your fork. When you create a fork from the original repo, the communication between the origin and the master (push/pull) is performed between the local repo and the form on your github.

In order for any changes made in the fork to be reflected, they have to be synced with a upstream remote.

To check the remote:
	$ git remote -v

To add upstream remote:
	$ git remote add upstream <URL of the ORIGINAL repo>

To sync:
	$ git fetch upstream
	$ git checkout master
	$ git merge upstrea/master
